## Workflow

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) manages dependencies and the Python
  virtualenv.
- [pytest](https://pytest.org/) is the test handler for those in `tests/`
- [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) is the primary linter and formatter.
- [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) runs the linting and
  formatting steps before a commit.
